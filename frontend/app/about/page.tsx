              This project was developed with the purpose of learning and
              studying web development, exploring API creation, front-end
              integration, and enhancing design and usability skills. The idea
              was to build a functional platform where you can search, filter,
              save, and organize travel destinations while practicing modern
              technologies. Built with â™¥.
